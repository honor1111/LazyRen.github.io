# Github io blog tips

### *Images*
  
- Google Drive
  
  It's very useful that just *`linking url in github io`*, while *saving image files in google drive*.  
  To achieve this comfort, 


Observed debugging :

1. __*Correct URL but image broken*__  
    
    Even though enabling `sharing option` at image, sometimes image broke like below.  
    ![broken image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ji6_t5spHDwKslnbQYmhAsiJ3bh1qc3g/view?usp=sharing)  

    Thanks to *[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52067077/6925796)*, we can share image by revising url slightly.  
    
    goal is : `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=XXX`    
    
    So, we can fix below url   
    from  
    drive.google.com/`file/d/`1ji6_t5spHDwKslnbQYmhAsiJ3bh1qc3g`/view?usp=sharing`  
    to  
    drive.google.com/`uc?export=view&id=`1ji6_t5spHDwKslnbQYmhAsiJ3bh1qc3g

    result should be :

    ![fixed](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ji6_t5spHDwKslnbQYmhAsiJ3bh1qc3g){: width="30%" height="20%"}
